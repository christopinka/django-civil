    Start the import process by presenting/accepting a form into
	which the user specifies the model for whom an XLS file is
	being uploaded and the file/path of the file to upload.
	
	The names of the models presented are either from those
	specified in the setting BATCH_IMPORT_IMPORTABLE_MODELS or
	using the installed_apps list for the project.
	
	The names of "relationships" (for the import of many-to-many
	data) are retrieved using reflection of the model's related fields
	and are in the format of
		"Mapping: [Source_Model]-[Target-Model]
	
	For example, suppose you have a model called Student which has
	a many to many relationship to a model called Parent. Then you
	would see the following added to the list of importable models:
		Mapping: Student-Parent
		
	NOTE: The list of mappings is also retrieved from the list of 
	importable models whether that comes from the 
	BATCH_IMPORT_IMPORTABLE_MODELS setting or from installed_apps.

def import_options(request, extra_context={}):
	"""
	This view allows the user to specify options for how the system should
	attempt to import the data in the uploaded Excel spreadsheet.
	
	There are two types of options: those that govern the process as a whole
	(whether to stop on errors, whether to update duplicates, etc) and options
	for mapping a given model field to a given spreadsheet column (as well as
	some other items about that model field.
	
	For Import of Object Data:
	In the case of a straight data import (of new objects as opposed to
	an import of relationship mapping information -- see below) the 
	following options are available to the user for each field in the model:
	
		field_name: This is a simple label showing the name of the specific
			model field. If it has an asterisk, that field is required in 
			the underlying model.
		
		Spreadsheet Column: This is a drop-down list of columns from the 
			spreadsheet. If no column headers are present, then each option
			shows the value in that column's cell.
		
		Is Identity: This allows the user to specify this specific spreadsheet
			value as being part of potentially multi-part "key" to identify
			whether or not this row in the spreadsheet refers to an object
			already in the database.
			
		Default Value: This is the value to use if the spreadsheet contains
			no data for that specific field.
			
		Mapping Field: For those fields that represent a related model, this
			item represents a list of fields on THAT (related) model. The
			user will select from these fields and the system will use that
			selection in trying to grab the appropriate object from the
			database using the value in the spreadsheet.
    
	For Import of Relationship/Mapping Data:
	In the case of the user uploading relationship data between models, the
	following options are presented to the user for each field in each 
	(source and target) model.
	
		model_name: This is a simple label showing the name of the source or
			target model.
			
		field_name: This is a simple label showing the name of the specific
			model field.
		
		Spreadsheet Column: This is a drop-down list of columns from the 
			spreadsheet. If no column headers are present, then each option
			shows the value in that column's cell.
		
		Is Identity: This allows the user to specify this specific spreadsheet
			value as being part of potentially multi-part "key" to identify
